                    <p>Unlike existing creator monetization platforms, with Colourbox supporters have true ownership of the 
                        exclusive access they buy from creators.This means that the fan can choose to resell their exclusive 
                        access if there is enough demand for it, much like artwork.</p>

                    <h1>What is our mission?</h1>
                    <p>Our mission is to allow creators to earn a meaningful income directly from their fanbase and supporters 
                        in a way that is also beneficial for supporters. This is important because it allows the creator to 
                        freely make the content they want to make and not have to worry about the opinions of a 3rd party.
                        It also creates more incentive for the supporter to grow with their favorite creator and stick with 
                        them through the journey.</p>
